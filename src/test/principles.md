##### F.I.R.S.T Principles

## Fast
## Independent
## Repeatable
## Self-Validating
## Thorough


# Unit tests should be fast. Faster tests => faster feedback.

# Tests should be isolated from others units. A Unit test should not share state with other units.

# Test result should be the same everytime with the same input. Can use mock values to do this.

# After the test is finished it should either be passing or failing

# Cover all the cases/paths/scenarios. Happy path, sad path, edge cases.
